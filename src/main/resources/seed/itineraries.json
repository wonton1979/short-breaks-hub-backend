You’ll get a balanced mix of headline sights, neighbourhood time, and practical breathing room—so you can enjoy meals, take photos, and recover between stops rather than sprinting all day.\n\nThis itinerary leans into what Luang Prabang does best: easy-to-reach highlights paired with small, local-feeling breaks that make the trip feel personal. Each day has a clear theme (icons, heritage, food, modern life, and an easy escape where it makes sense), plus simple transport guidance and timing tips. If you want a slower pace, you can swap one attraction for a longer café break and still keep the itinerary coherent. By the end you’ll have a confident, first-hand feel for how locals move, where they eat, and which corners of the city match your style.",

You’ll get a balanced mix of headline sights, neighbourhood time, and practical breathing room—so you can enjoy meals, take photos, and recover between stops rather than sprinting all day.\n\nThis itinerary leans into what Bagan does best: easy-to-reach highlights paired with small, local-feeling breaks that make the trip feel personal. Each day has a clear theme (icons, heritage, food, modern life, and an easy escape where it makes sense), plus simple transport guidance and timing tips. If you want a slower pace, you can swap one attraction for a longer café break and still keep the itinerary coherent.

Each day has a clear theme (icons, heritage, food, modern life, and an easy escape where it makes sense), plus simple transport guidance and timing tips. If you want a slower pace, you can swap one attraction for a longer café break and still keep the itinerary coherent.

You’ll get a balanced mix of headline sights, neighbourhood time, and practical breathing room—so you can enjoy meals, take photos, and recover between stops rather than sprinting all day.\n\nThis itinerary leans into what Guilin does best: easy-to-reach highlights paired with small, local-feeling breaks that make the trip feel personal. Each day has a clear theme (icons, heritage, food, modern life, and an easy escape where it makes sense), plus simple transport guidance and timing tips. If you want a slower pace, you can swap one attraction for a longer café break and still keep the itinerary coherent. By the end you’ll have a confident, first-hand feel for how locals move, where they eat, and which corners of the city match your style.",

You’ll get a balanced mix of headline sights, neighbourhood time, and practical breathing room—so you can enjoy meals, take photos, and recover between stops rather than sprinting all day.\n\nThink of this as a practical, confidence-building route through Hualien, with enough flexibility to follow your curiosity without losing structure. Each day has a clear theme (icons, heritage, food, modern life, and an easy escape where it makes sense), plus simple transport guidance and timing tips. If you want a slower pace, you can swap one attraction for a longer café break and still keep the itinerary coherent. By the end you’ll have a confident, first-hand feel for how locals move, where they eat, and which corners of the city match your style.",

Choose lunch near your main daytime area so you do not lose momentum, then reserve the evening for something that feels local—street stalls, a night market, a waterfront walk with snacks, or a neighbourhood restaurant where you can slow down. If you prefer budget-friendly options, food courts and small family-run places typically give the best value and variety.\n\nIn the afternoon, add one “texture” activity: browse a market, step into a small gallery, visit a place of worship respectfully, or sit with a coffee and people-watch for 20 minutes. These pauses help the destination sink in.

Take time inside to absorb the atmosphere rather than rushing through—this is one of the true highlights of the entire trip.\n\nAfter exiting King’s College, step directly into the historic centre and explore Senate House Passage and the surrounding university streets. Walk towards Market Square, where Cambridge’s open-air market has traded for centuries. This area offers an excellent first impression of daily life in the city, blending university tradition with local commerce.\n\nSpend the afternoon walking slowly through the nearby streets and lanes, soaking in the architecture and collegiate atmosphere. Pause for lunch near the market or along Trinity Street, where many cafés are set within historic buildings. Keep the pace gentle—this day is about orientation and immersion rather than distance.\n\nIn the late afternoon, take a short walk towards Great St Mary’s Church. While climbing the tower is optional, the exterior and surrounding square are key elements of Cambridge’s historic core and frequently appear in top visitor recommendations. End the day with a relaxed evening walk back through the city centre, enjoying the calm, scholarly atmosphere that Cambridge is known for."

Take time to explore their courtyards and gardens, paying attention to the architectural contrast between different centuries of construction. St John’s College is also home to the Mathematical Bridge, a small but famous landmark frequently included in visitor top-10 lists.\n\nLate morning or early afternoon is the ideal time for a traditional River Cam punting tour.

Whether guided or self-punted, the journey offers unique views of the colleges from the water and provides historical commentary that brings the city’s past to life.\n\nAfter punting, enjoy a relaxed lunch nearby and spend the remainder of the afternoon revisiting favourite spots along The Backs or sitting by the river.

Allow enough time to explore at least one or two sections in depth rather than attempting to see everything.\n\nAfter the museum visit, take a gentle walk back towards the city centre, passing through areas you may now recognise from earlier days. This familiarity adds to the sense of completion and connection with the city. Stop for lunch at a café near the historic core or along one of the quieter side streets.\n\nIn the afternoon, revisit Market Square or nearby streets for last-minute browsing and souvenirs. If time allows, enjoy a final walk along the River Cam or through a college garden you particularly enjoyed earlier in the trip. The final day is intentionally unhurried, giving space to reflect on the experience rather than introducing new major sights.\n\nFinish your Cambridge stay with a relaxed evening meal in the city centre, marking the end of a compact but complete introduction to one of England’s most historic and beautiful university cities."

Each day has a clear theme (icons, heritage, food, modern life, and an easy escape where it makes sense), plus simple transport guidance and timing tips. If you want a slower pace, you can swap one attraction for a longer café break and still keep the itinerary coherent.

You’ll get a balanced mix of headline sights, neighbourhood time, and practical breathing room—so you can enjoy meals, take photos, and recover between stops rather than sprinting all day.\n\nIn Italy, the best moments often happen between the big sights—at a café table, a market stall, or a scenic walk when the light turns golden. Each day has a clear theme (icons, heritage, food, modern life, and an easy escape where it makes sense), plus simple transport guidance and timing tips. If you want a slower pace, you can swap one attraction for a longer café break and still keep the itinerary coherent.

You’ll get a balanced mix of headline sights, neighbourhood time, and practical breathing room—so you can enjoy meals, take photos, and recover between stops rather than sprinting all day.\n\nIn United States, the best moments often happen between the big sights—at a café table, a market stall, or a scenic walk when the light turns golden. Each day has a clear theme (icons, heritage, food, modern life, and an easy escape where it makes sense), plus simple transport guidance and timing tips. If you want a slower pace, you can swap one attraction for a longer café break and still keep the itinerary coherent. By the end you’ll have a confident, first-hand feel for how locals move, where they eat, and which corners of the city match your style.",

You’ll get a balanced mix of headline sights, neighbourhood time, and practical breathing room—so you can enjoy meals, take photos, and recover between stops rather than sprinting all day.\n\nThis itinerary leans into what Miami does best: easy-to-reach highlights paired with small, local-feeling breaks that make the trip feel personal. Each day has a clear theme (icons, heritage, food, modern life, and an easy escape where it makes sense), plus simple transport guidance and timing tips. If you want a slower pace, you can swap one attraction for a longer café break and still keep the itinerary coherent. By the end you’ll have a confident, first-hand feel for how locals move, where they eat, and which corners of the city match your style.",

You’ll get a balanced mix of headline sights, neighbourhood time, and practical breathing room—so you can enjoy meals, take photos, and recover between stops rather than sprinting all day.\n\nThis itinerary leans into what Vancouver does best: easy-to-reach highlights paired with small, local-feeling breaks that make the trip feel personal. Each day has a clear theme (icons, heritage, food, modern life, and an easy escape where it makes sense), plus simple transport guidance and timing tips. If you want a slower pace, you can swap one attraction for a longer café break and still keep the itinerary coherent. By the end you’ll have a confident, first-hand feel for how locals move, where they eat, and which corners of the city match your style.",

You’ll get a balanced mix of headline sights, neighbourhood time, and practical breathing room—so you can enjoy meals, take photos, and recover between stops rather than sprinting all day.\n\nThink of this as a practical, confidence-building route through Calgary, with enough flexibility to follow your curiosity without losing structure. Each day has a clear theme (icons, heritage, food, modern life, and an easy escape where it makes sense), plus simple transport guidance and timing tips. If you want a slower pace, you can swap one attraction for a longer café break and still keep the itinerary coherent.

You’ll get a balanced mix of headline sights, neighbourhood time, and practical breathing room—so you can enjoy meals, take photos, and recover between stops rather than sprinting all day.\n\nThis itinerary leans into what San José does best: easy-to-reach highlights paired with small, local-feeling breaks that make the trip feel personal. Each day has a clear theme (icons, heritage, food, modern life, and an easy escape where it makes sense), plus simple transport guidance and timing tips. If you want a slower pace, you can swap one attraction for a longer café break and still keep the itinerary coherent. By the end you’ll have a confident, first-hand feel for how locals move, where they eat, and which corners of the city match your style.",

Aim to arrive at popular places either early or later in the day to avoid peak crowds. If you like planning, pin two nearby backup stops so you can pivot instantly if a museum is closed, rain arrives, or queues are longer than expected.\n\nFood is a big part of today.

Choose lunch near your main daytime area so you do not lose momentum, then reserve the evening for something that feels local—street stalls, a night market, a waterfront walk with snacks, or a neighbourhood restaurant where you can slow down. If you prefer budget-friendly options, food courts and small family-run places typically give the best value and variety.\n\nIn the afternoon, add one “texture” activity: browse a market, step into a small gallery, visit a place of worship respectfully, or sit with a coffee and people-watch for 20 minutes.

You’ll get a balanced mix of headline sights, neighbourhood time, and practical breathing room—so you can enjoy meals, take photos, and recover between stops rather than sprinting all day.\n\nIn New Zealand, the best moments often happen between the big sights—at a café table, a market stall, or a scenic walk when the light turns golden. Each day has a clear theme (icons, heritage, food, modern life, and an easy escape where it makes sense), plus simple transport guidance and timing tips. If you want a slower pace, you can swap one attraction for a longer café break and still keep the itinerary coherent. By the end you’ll have a confident, first-hand feel for how locals move, where they eat, and which corners of the city match your style.",

    "summary": "This 6-day plan is designed to feel like a great story in Cape Town: a strong opening with the city’s icons, a satisfying middle with culture and local flavours, and a relaxed finish that leaves you wanting to return. You’ll get a balanced mix of headline sights, neighbourhood time, and practical breathing room—so you can enjoy meals, take photos, and recover between stops rather than sprinting all day.\n\nThis itinerary leans into what Cape Town does best: easy-to-reach highlights paired with small, local-feeling breaks that make the trip feel personal. Each day has a clear theme (icons, heritage, food, modern life, and an easy escape where it makes sense), plus simple transport guidance and timing tips. If you want a slower pace, you can swap one attraction for a longer café break and still keep the itinerary coherent. By the end you’ll have a confident, first-hand feel for how locals move, where they eat, and which corners of the city match your style.",

Aim to arrive at popular places either early or later in the day to avoid peak crowds. If you like planning, pin two nearby backup stops so you can pivot instantly if a museum is closed, rain arrives, or queues are longer than expected.\n\nFood is a big part of today. Build it into the plan rather than treating it as an afterthought. Choose lunch near your main daytime area so you do not lose momentum, then reserve the evening for something that feels local—street stalls, a night market, a waterfront walk with snacks, or a neighbourhood restaurant where you can slow down. If you prefer budget-friendly options, food courts and small family-run places typically give the best value and variety.\n\nIn the afternoon, add one “texture” activity: browse a market, step into a small gallery, visit a place of worship respectfully, or sit with a coffee and people-watch for 20 minutes. These pauses help the destination sink in. Finish with a gentle golden-hour stroll—parks, riverfronts, or a viewpoint—then do a quick reset: back up photos, pin tomorrow’s first stop, and get a realistic bedtime so you wake up fresh.\n\nToday’s key ingredients:\n- design district\n- shopping street\n- food hall\n- easy nightlife option\n\n\nLocal flavour: ask what locals snack on between meals, and try one small thing you would not normally order—this is often where the best stories come from."

You’ll get a balanced mix of headline sights, neighbourhood time, and practical breathing room—so you can enjoy meals, take photos, and recover between stops rather than sprinting all day.\n\nThink of this as a practical, confidence-building route through Mombasa, with enough flexibility to follow your curiosity without losing structure. Each day has a clear theme (icons, heritage, food, modern life, and an easy escape where it makes sense), plus simple transport guidance and timing tips. If you want a slower pace, you can swap one attraction for a longer café break and still keep the itinerary coherent. By the end you’ll have a confident, first-hand feel for how locals move, where they eat, and which corners of the city match your style.",

If you want a slower pace, you can swap one attraction for a longer café break and still keep the itinerary coherent.

        "details": "Start day 3 with a clear focus: city icons & orientation in Volcanoes National Park. Begin in the cooler hours and choose one “anchor” stop that sets the mood—think a central square, a famous skyline viewpoint, or the most walkable heritage street. From there, keep your route in clusters so you spend more time experiencing and less time commuting. A good rhythm is: one headline sight, one slower cultural stop, a proper meal, and then a relaxed afternoon block where you can follow your curiosity.\n\nUse local transport in the simplest way available. Aim to arrive at popular places either early or later in the day to avoid peak crowds. If you like planning, pin two nearby backup stops so you can pivot instantly if a museum is closed, rain arrives, or queues are longer than expected.\n\nFood is a big part of today. Build it into the plan rather than treating it as an afterthought. Choose lunch near your main daytime area so you do not lose momentum, then reserve the evening for something that feels local—street stalls, a night market, a waterfront walk with snacks, or a neighbourhood restaurant where you can slow down. If you prefer budget-friendly options, food courts and small family-run places typically give the best value and variety.\n\nIn the afternoon, add one “texture” activity: browse a market, step into a small gallery, visit a place of worship respectfully, or sit with a coffee and people-watch for 20 minutes. These pauses help the destination sink in. Finish with a gentle golden-hour stroll—parks, riverfronts, or a viewpoint—then do a quick reset: back up photos, pin tomorrow’s first stop, and get a realistic bedtime so you wake up fresh.\n\nToday’s key ingredients:\n- top landmarks\n- easy scenic walk\n- transport tips\n- sunset viewpoint\n\n\nLocal flavour: ask what locals snack on between meals, and try one small thing you would not normally order—this is often where the best stories come from."
